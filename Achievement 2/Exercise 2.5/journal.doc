Favorite recipes apps



1. CookBookManager
  - Im sure the code is quite extensive but I can see how i would build this in django.
  - Theres a lot of features this site offers. Imports, Tags, Tools ..etc
2. Umami
  - This one does not have as much features, I enjoy the simplicity of this app.
  - Easy to add recipes and view them.
3. Cookpad
  - This app seems to be more ingredients focused.
  - Able to find lots of recipes.
